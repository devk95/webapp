				<p>And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' 
				And you may be right. Just think about these things in your mind - 
				then bring them into your world. Painting should do one thing. It should put 
				happiness in your heart.Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. 
				The little tiny Tim easels will let you down. Making all those little fluffies
				that live in the clouds.</p>
